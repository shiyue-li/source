case_description: "In Summer 2018 and 2019, I taught 9 week-long courses on algebraic number theory, modular forms, geometric group theory, rational points on elliptic curves, tropical plane curves, group theory, Young tableaux at Mathcamp. "
case_summary: "In Summer 2018, I taught 5 week-long courses on algebraic number theory, modular forms, geometric group theory, rational points on elliptic curves and tropical plane curves at Mathcamp. In Summer 2019, I taught 3 themed courses on Young Tableaux. They demonstrate the connections of Young Tableaux with representation theory, combinatorics, and probability. I also taught Introduction to Group Theory. Notes are coming up soon."
