                    We recall the definition ofrelative  Bott-Samelson  varieties, and prove that product of two relative Bott-Samelson schemes is a resolution of singularities of relative Richardson varieties defined with respect toversalflags. This reflects the nature that local geometry of relative Richardson varieties is completely governed by the two intersecting relative degeneracy loci, studied by Chan and Pflueger in 2019.  Along the way, we generalize results regarding local geometry of intersection of degeneracy loci with respect to versal flags, defined by Chan and Pflueger, to general Lie types.  We then present geometric and cohomological results about relative Bott-Samelson varieties and their products analogous to Brion's notes on flag varieties in type A. Such construction yields an application to resolution of singularities of Brill-Noether variteies with imposed ramification in the two-pointed case. See work by Chan, Osserman and Pflueger in 2018.

                    <br>
                    (with Siddarth Kannan and Dagan Karp)
                    <br>
                    Heavy/light Hassett spaces are moduli space of rational curves with weighted marked points that satisfy a “heavy/light” and a stability condition.
                    We present a computation of the Chow ring of such spaces via Tropical Geometry. Our computation weaves together many beautiful combinatorial gadgets that appear in algebraic geometry. The starting point of our computation is to view these spaces as tropical compactifications of hyperplane arrangement complements, using work by Cavalieri-Hampe-Markwig-Ranganathan. Then the computation of the Chow ring then reduces to intersection theory on the toric variety of the Bergman fan of a graphic matroid. In particular, this reduction allows us to bijectively correspond divisors of the related toric variety to trees with stable weighted rays, thereby computing the final Chow ring combinatorially.
