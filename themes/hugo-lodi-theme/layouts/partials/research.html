                We prove that, defined with respect to versal flags, the product of two relative Bott-Samelson varieties over the flag bundle is a resolution of singularities of a relative Richardson variety. This result generalizes Brion's resolution of singularities of Richardson varieties to the relative setting. It reflects the phenomenon that the local geometry of a relative Richardson variety is completely governed by the two intersecting relative Schubert varieties, studied by Chan-Pflueger. We also prove an analogous theorem in the case of relative Grassmannian Richardson varieties, thereby furnishing a resolution of singularities for the Brill-Noether variety with imposed ramification on twice-marked elliptic curves.

                    <br> We show that the moduli spaces of weighted stable tropical curves of volume one are simply-connected for all genus greater than zero and all rational weights, under the framework of symmetric Delta-complexes and via a result by Allcock-Corey-Payne 19. We also calculate the Euler characteristics of these spaces and the top weight Euler characteristics of the classical Hassett spaces by exhibiting a useful decomposition of the class of the classical Hassett spaces in the Grothendieck group of varieties.

                    Heavy/light Hassett spaces are moduli space of rational curves with weighted marked points that satisfy a “heavy/light” and a stability condition.
                    We present a computation of the Chow ring of such spaces via tropical geometry. Our computation weaves together many beautiful combinatorial gadgets that appear in algebraic geometry. The starting point of our computation is to view these spaces as tropical compactifications of hyperplane arrangement complements, using work by Cavalieri-Hampe-Markwig-Ranganathan. Then the computation of the Chow ring then reduces to intersection theory on the toric variety of the Bergman fan of a graphic matroid. In particular, this reduction allows us to bijectively correspond divisors of the related toric variety to trees with stable weighted rays, thereby computing the final Chow ring combinatorially.
